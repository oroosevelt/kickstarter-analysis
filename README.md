Overview The graph visualizes the percentage of outcomes by month for the parent category filtered by "Theater."

Analysis -The goal was to make sure I was able to filter the parent category by genre and years. The pivot table then needed to display the results of "theater" by the outcomes for each month for all the years combined. Therefore making it easier to understand, which month had the most results for each outcome.

Challenges -Some of the challenges I faced were filtering the field names in to the correct filters for the pivot table. Before begining. I switched the fields in to differet sections of the PivotTable Fields. This helped me understand the purpose of each fields sections and how the information will be used. 

In conclusion, Two conclusions are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
